                    <p class = "typedContent" style = "font-size: 20px;">Quotation 1 - “Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world. Like a Colossus, and we petty men. Walk under his huge legs, and peep about. To find ourselves dishonorable graves.” (Act 1, Scene 2, Pg 7) Explenation - Here Cassius shows his concern and jealousy over the rise of Ceaser and how his ambition could lead to Ceaser overpowering them. It is this uncerntanty over Ceasers intentions along with the idea that Ceaser is overly ambitious that will result in Cassius plotting against Ceaser</p>
                    <p class = "typedContent"  id = "evidence2" style = "font-size: 20px;">Quotation 2 -  “It must be by his death: and for my part, I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be crowned: How that might change his nature, there’s the question.” (Act 2, Scene 1, Pg 18) Brutus is at a crossroads between staying loyal to Ceaser or betraying him, and his fear of what Ceaser will do if his ambtiion leads him to consolidate too much power motivates him to go against Ceaser, a descision that he will ultimately regret.</p>
